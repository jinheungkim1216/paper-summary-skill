# paper-summary

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that turns a research paper
into a structured, grounded summary — and renders it to PDF.

Give it an arXiv id, a local PDF, or a URL. It fetches the paper (preferring the
**LaTeX source**, so equations and figures survive intact), writes a sectioned
summary with every number traced back to the source, and produces a typeset PDF.

## Why the LaTeX source matters

Most tools read the PDF and get mangled equations and no usable figures. This one
downloads the arXiv e-print source first, so:

- equations come from the real `\begin{equation}`, not from OCR'd glyphs
- figures are the original files, not screenshots — including `.eps`, which
  older hep-ph/hep-th papers use almost exclusively
- `\cite{}` keys resolve against the shipped `.bbl`, so related-work claims name
  actual papers

PDF and web extraction are the fallbacks, not the default path.

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add jinheungkim1216/paper-summary-skill
/plugin install paper-summary@paper-summary-skill
```

Update later with `/plugin marketplace update paper-summary-skill`.

### Dependencies

**Required** — `uv` (runs `ingest.py` with its own deps), `pandoc` and `typst`
(the PDF step).

**Recommended** — `ghostscript` (converts EPS/PS figures; without it those
figures are skipped), and a Hangul font for Korean output (macOS ships Apple SD
Gothic Neo; on Linux install Noto Sans CJK KR or NanumGothic).

```bash
brew install uv pandoc typst ghostscript
```

`skills/paper-summary/scripts/setup.sh` reports exactly what is missing and how
to install it.

## Usage

Once installed, just ask Claude Code:

```
이 논문 요약해줘 https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
summarize arxiv 2005.14165
(drop a PDF) 이거 정리해줘
```

Output lands in a per-paper folder in your current directory:

```
attention-is-all-you-need/
├── manifest.json     # what was ingested, and how
├── source/           # the paper's .tex / .pdf
├── figures/          # extracted figures, normalized to PNG
├── summary.md        # the deliverable
└── summary.pdf       # typeset via pandoc → typst
```

## How it works

The skill splits acquisition from writing. Scripts fetch and verify; the model
reads and writes. It never re-implements downloading or parsing.

```
input → ingest.py → [model reads + writes] → verify.py → render_pdf.sh
         manifest       summary.md            grounding      PDF
```

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1. Ingest | `ingest.py` resolves the input and writes `manifest.json` |
| 2. Read | Two passes: skim for structure, then ground every claim |
| 3. Domain | Apply the field-specific checklist from `domains/` |
| 4. Write | `summary.md` from a fixed 10-section template |
| 5. Verify | `verify.py` traces every number back to the source |
| 6. Render | `md → typ → pdf` |
| 7. Report | Paths, ingest method, warnings, accepted exceptions |

### Grounding

The summary format is built around not making things up:

- numbers and quotes are copied verbatim; anything inferred is tagged `(추론)` /
  `(inferred)` so it is never presented as the paper's own claim
- each key claim carries a reference tag (`§4.1, Table 3`)
- `verify.py` then checks the result — it extracts every number in the summary
  and reports the ones it cannot find in the ingested source

`verify.py` is deliberately conservative: reference tags, figure paths, layout
attributes and inference-marked lines are excluded, because a false alarm costs
more attention than a miss. It reports; it does not block (`--strict` changes
that).

```
$ uv run skills/paper-summary/scripts/verify.py ./attention-is-all-you-need
verify: 7 number(s) checked, 1 not found in source

  summary.md:8          99.7  |  - 정확도가 **99.7** 로 향상되었다 (§6.2, Table 3).
```

### Domain supplements

`manifest.domain` is inferred from the arXiv category and selects a checklist:

- **hep** — branches further on hep-ex / hep-ph / hep-th / hep-lat (luminosity
  and systematics vs. EFT parameter space vs. lattice ensembles)
- **ai** — architecture, training setup, compute, ablations, reproducibility
- **physics** — regime of validity, governing equations, uncertainties
- **general** — claim scope, evidence type, threats to validity

Edit a clone of this repo, not the installed copy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinheungkim1216/paper-summary-skill.git
cd paper-summary-skill

./skills/paper-summary/tests/run.sh              # deps come from uv, no venv needed
./skills/paper-summary/tests/run.sh -q -k figure # a single test
```

There is no version field — the git SHA is the version, so pushing here is the
release. Pick the change up with `/plugin marketplace update paper-summary-skill`.

The suite covers figure-name collisions, EPS conversion, font selection across
platforms, the stdout contract, remote-PDF routing, and the grounding checker's
exclusion rules.
