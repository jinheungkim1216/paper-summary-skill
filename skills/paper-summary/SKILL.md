# Paper Summary

Turn a paper (arXiv id/URL, local PDF, or web URL) into a structured, faithful
summary written to a per-paper work folder, then render it to PDF.

**Core split:** `ingest.py` (a `uv` script) acquires the paper and writes a
`manifest.json`; YOU read the manifest and content and write the summary. Do not
re-implement downloading/parsing — that is the script's job.

**Skill layout:** `<SKILL_DIR>` is the directory containing this SKILL.md (the
skill's base directory, given to you when the skill is invoked). Helper scripts
live in `<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/` (`ingest.py`, `verify.py`, `render_pdf.sh`,
`setup.sh`) and domain guides in `<SKILL_DIR>/domains/`. Substitute the real
path for `<SKILL_DIR>`.

## Workflow

### 1. Ingest

Run the ingestion engine, with the user's current working directory as base:

```bash
uv run <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/ingest.py "<INPUT>" --base-dir "$(pwd)"
```

`<INPUT>` is the arXiv id/URL, local PDF path, or web URL the user gave. Use a
different `--base-dir` if the user wants output somewhere specific. Add
`--domain hep|ai|physics|general` only if the user explicitly overrides the
domain. The last stdout line is the absolute path of `manifest.json`. Read it.

The script tries **arXiv e-print source (.tex + figures) first** — including for
local PDFs *and remote PDF URLs* that turn out to be arXiv papers — and falls
back to PDF/URL text extraction. The work folder it creates holds `source/`,
`figures/`, any `extracted.txt`, and the manifest. Everything you produce goes
in this folder.

`manifest.ingest_method` is one of `arxiv-source` (best), `arxiv-pdf`,
`local-pdf`, `url-pdf` (a URL that served a PDF), or `url`.

Fields worth knowing before you start reading:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `content_chars` | Size of what you must read. See the fan-out rule in step 2. |
| `all_tex` | Every `.tex` in the source — the main file `\input`s these. |
| `bibliography` | `.bbl`/`.bib` paths. Resolve `\cite{}` keys here for related work. |
| `figures` | Collected figure paths, relative to the work folder. |
| `figures_map` | `\includegraphics` path → collected file. Use it; do not guess. |
| `warnings` | Anything that degraded the ingest. Surface these in step 7. |

**If ingest fails** (no `work_dir`, or `main_content` is null): report the
`manifest.warnings` to the user and stop — do not write a summary from nothing.

### 2. Read the paper (2-pass + grounding)

- **Pass 1 — skim:** read the main content for structure, claims, and
  contributions. For `arxiv-source`, the main file is `manifest.main_content`
  (a `.tex`); it usually `\input`s the files in `manifest.all_tex` — read those
  too. For `local-pdf`/`arxiv-pdf`/`url`, read `manifest.extracted_text`.
- **Pass 2 — deep:** go section by section and **ground every nontrivial claim
  in the source**, tagging it with a reference (see grounding rules below).
- **Related work:** resolve `\cite{}` keys against `manifest.bibliography` so
  you name the actual prior papers instead of paraphrasing the citation.
- **Long papers (incl. appendices):** when `manifest.content_chars` exceeds
  ~150,000, dispatch one subagent per major section to read and return
  structured notes, then synthesize. This preserves your context budget.

### 3. Apply the domain supplement

Read `<SKILL_DIR>/domains/<manifest.domain>.md` and follow it to fill the domain
supplement section. For `hep`, branch on `manifest.domain_subcategory` (hep-ex /
hep-ph / hep-th / hep-lat).

### 4. Write `summary.md`

Write to `<work_dir>/summary.md` using the template below. The first line must be
`# <Paper Title> — 요약` (or `— Summary` in English) so the PDF picks up the title.

### 5. Verify the numbers

Trace every number in the summary back to the source:

```bash
uv run <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/verify.py "<work_dir>"
```

It prints each number it could not find in the ingested source, with the line
it appears on. For every one reported, do one of:

- **Fix it** — you mistyped or misread; correct it against the source.
- **Mark it** — it is genuinely your own derivation; tag the claim `(추론)` /
  `(해석)` so it is not presented as the paper's own number.
- **Keep it** — the checker is deliberately conservative and can miss a value
  that is split across a table cell or written in a different notation. Confirm
  it in the source yourself before deciding this.

Re-run until every remaining report is one you have consciously accepted. The
checker never blocks: it exits 0 regardless (use `--strict` to make it exit 1).

### 6. Render the PDF (best-effort)

Run the bundled Typst renderer on the summary:

```bash
<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/render_pdf.sh "<work_dir>/summary.md"
```

This goes `md → typ → pdf` (pandoc → typst), producing `summary.pdf` (and
`summary.typ`) in the work folder. No browser/MathJax needed: math is
Typst-native and Korean uses a CJK font fallback. Relative `figures/...` paths
resolve because the renderer sets Typst's root to the work folder.

**If rendering fails** (e.g. `pandoc` or `typst` not installed — run
`<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/setup.sh` to check what's missing): do NOT abort. Keep the completed
`summary.md`, tell the user the PDF was skipped and why, and that they can install
the missing tool and re-run. The Markdown is the primary deliverable; the PDF is
a convenience.

### 7. Report

Tell the user the work-folder path, the `summary.md` (and `summary.pdf` if
produced) paths, the ingest method and domain used, and surface any
`manifest.warnings` and whether the PDF step succeeded. If you accepted any
number that `verify.py` flagged, say which and why.

## Summary method (non-negotiable)

- **Faithful, expert-level, with intuition.** Assume a researcher reader. Skip
  textbook basics; explain the *key* ideas and equations down to their intuition.
- **Reproduce key equations** in `$...$`/`$$...$$`, defining every symbol the
  first time it appears. Use Typst/pandoc-compatible LaTeX — write `\mathrm{...}`,
  not the bare `\rm`/`\bf` (the renderer normalizes common `\rm`→`\mathrm`, but
  other deprecated TeX may fail to convert and render as raw text).
- **Figures:** if `manifest.figures` is non-empty, pick the genuinely
  load-bearing figures (architecture, main result) and embed them with a relative
  path **and a width attribute** so they don't dominate the page, e.g.
  `![인코더-디코더 구조](figures/modalnet-21.png){ width=60% }`. The `{ width=NN% }`
  is REQUIRED — without it figures render uncomfortably large. The width attribute
  carries through pandoc into Typst (`image(..., width: 60%)`). Default to ~60%;
  use ~45% for simple/wide plots and up to ~75% only for dense multi-panel
  figures. To resolve `\includegraphics{Figures/ModalNet-21}`, look the path up
  in `manifest.figures_map` — do not guess the slugified filename. Do not dump
  every figure. **If `manifest.figures` is empty, skip figures entirely** — do
  not invent or hunt for them.
  **Do not start the alt text with "Figure 1:"** — the renderer already numbers
  captions, so you would get "그림 1: Figure 1: ...".
- **Markdown hygiene for clean PDF:** put a blank line before every list and
  table — a bullet list placed right after a `:` line gets flattened into one
  paragraph by the renderer. Avoid a `## ` heading immediately after a `---`.
- **Anti-hallucination (hard rules):**
  - Copy numbers and quotes **verbatim** from the source. Never invent or round
    silently. If a value is unclear, say so.
  - Mark anything not stated by the paper — your inference or reading — with
    `(추론)` / `(해석)` (or `(inferred)` / `(interpretation)`).
  - Put a reference tag on each key claim. Prefer rendered numbers when the
    source has them: `(§4.1, Table 3, Fig. 5)`. **For `arxiv-source` ingests the
    `.tex` usually has only `\label{}` names, not rendered numbers** — then tag
    with the section number plus the label or a short locator, e.g.
    `(§4, eq. "punch")`, and never fabricate a number.
  - Keep ambiguous technical terms in the original language alongside any
    translation.
- **Language:** match the user's request. Korean request → Korean body with
  English term annotation, e.g. 어텐션(attention). English request → all English
  (translate the template headings). No clear signal → follow the conversation
  language.

Headings below show `한국어 (English)` — keep both for a Korean summary's term
annotation, or use the English side alone for an English summary.

## When NOT to use

- The user wants a one-line answer or a quick question about a paper, not a
  written summary → just answer.
- The user wants you to *implement* a paper's method → that's a coding task.

## Common mistakes

- **Re-downloading by hand.** Always go through `ingest.py`; it handles arXiv
  source, the PDF→arXiv shortcut, and web extraction.
- **Reading only the main `.tex`.** It `\input`s other files — read
  `manifest.all_tex` too, or the body will be missing.
- **Embedding figures by absolute path, embedding all of them, embedding them at
  full page width (always add `{ width=~60% }`), or hunting for figures when
  `manifest.figures` is empty.**
- **Guessing a figure's filename** instead of looking it up in
  `manifest.figures_map`.
- **Inventing numbers or fabricating reference numbers** the source doesn't
  render. Trace every metric to the source with an honest tag.
- **Skipping `verify.py`, or silencing it by deleting the number** instead of
  correcting it or marking it `(추론)`.
- **Aborting when PDF rendering fails.** Keep `summary.md` and report — the
  Markdown is the deliverable.
- **Writing the summary outside the work folder.** Keep all artifacts together.
